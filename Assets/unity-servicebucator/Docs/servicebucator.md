## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Language**: C#  
- **Engine**: Unity

---

### Installation

You can install Unity-ServiceButcator in one of two ways:

1. **Direct Copy**  
   - Download the repository and copy the `Unity-ServiceButcator` folder into your Unity project‚Äôs `Assets/` directory.  

2. **Unity Package Import**  
   - Download the `unity-servicebucator.unitypackage` release from the repository and import it into Unity using  
     `Assets ‚Üí Import Package ‚Üí Custom Package...`

---

## Usage

Unity-ServiceButcator supports **three installation patterns**, depending on your needs:

### 1. Editor-Only Services

- Open **Window ‚Üí ServiceButcator ‚Üí EditorInstallerWindow** to access the editor UI.  
- Register and manage your services directly through the editor.  
- **Note:** In Edit Mode, only `UnityEngine.Object` assets that exist on disk (not scene objects) can be registered.

---

### 2. Scene-Based Services

Create a class that inherits from `SceneInstaller`, and override the `Binds()` method to register your services at scene startup:

```csharp
using ServiceButcator;

public class ExampleSceneInstaller : SceneInstaller
{
    [SerializeField] private AService sevice;

    protected override void Binds()
    {
        serviceLocator.RegisterService<IMyService>(sevice);
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Global Services
Similar to `Scene-Based Services`, but with support for `DontDestroyOnLoad`, allowing services to persist across multiple scenes. Perfect for global systems like AudioManager, SaveDataService, or Analytics, ...
